### In short... <br/> 前言...
This post summarizes the butterfly observations uploaded to the corresponding [iNaturalist project](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/butterflies-of-china) up to April 3rd, 2020. Only records from Mainland China is included for analysis (For other regions please click: [Hong Kong](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/butterflies-of-hong-kong-8af315f2-e6d6-4956-b73a-aad48af9615b), [Taiwan](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/butterflies-of-taiwan). Macau is currently unavailable). We appreciated all members of the project, including all uploaders for sharing their data to the iNat platform. Special thanks to [sunwenhao90](https://www.inaturalist.org/people/sunwenhao90) for his huge effort in identification.

这篇博文总结了截止2020年4月3日，用户上传到[iNaturalist中国蝴蝶观测项目](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/butterflies-of-china)上的蝴蝶记录。以下总结只针对中国内地/大陆的数据，其他地区请点击：[香港](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/butterflies-of-hong-kong-8af315f2-e6d6-4956-b73a-aad48af9615b), [台湾](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/butterflies-of-taiwan)（暂无澳门）。感谢所有分享过数据给iNat的用户，特别鸣谢[sunwenhao90](https://www.inaturalist.org/people/sunwenhao90)在鉴定上做的大量工作。

### Distribution of records through time <br/> 记录随时间的分布

#### Time of the observation 记录时间

#### Time of the upload 上传时间

The website iNaturalist was first launched back in 2008 as a final project of three students' Master thesis. We see that the first butterfly record from Mainland China appeared around early 2013, 5 years after its birth. Large amount of butterfly data were generated mostly in the last three years. Although uploading observations reaches the peak usually in summer, there are also plenty of uploads within the recent winter.

### Distribution of records through taxonomy <br/> 记录在分类树上的分布

There are, to date, around 711 distinct butterfly species observed the Mainland China database. While the exact taxonomy is still debatable (e.g. whether *Hestina nama* should be *Hestinalis nama*), the overall distribution across the butterfly phylogeny is robust to such minor effect. We use the [NCBI taxonomy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy) as a backbone to generate the classification tree among 711 species, as shown in the following figure. (Heads-up: this is not a phylogeny.) Each tip represents a unique species, and a multispecies genus is represented by a node at the second level. The phylogenetic relationship among families is omitted, and we still treat Riodinidae as a separate family, as opposed to treating it as a subfamily in Lycaenidae.

There are a few visible trends from the figure:
* Nearly half of the species recorded are within Nymphalidae;
* Half of the Lycaenid species are observed monotypically in their genus;
* Hesperiidae represents about 1/8 of the observations, but comparatively, each species has fewer records. i.e. no observation hotspots!
