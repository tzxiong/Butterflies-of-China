## Foreword... <br/> 前言...

Recently our lab published a new research on a hybrid zone between *Papilio maackii* and *Papilio syfanius* in SW China. Here I use simple words to explain what we found from this paper:

Xiong, T., Li, X., Yago, M. and Mallet, J., 2022. Admixture of evolutionary rates across a butterfly hybrid zone. *eLife*, 11, p.e78135.

The paper is open-access on the publisher's website ([link](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.78135)).
